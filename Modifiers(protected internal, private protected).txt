Protected:
	Protected members can be accessed within that class or in the class that is deriving it.
	But protected members can never be accessed by creating an object of the class. 
	Protected members can be accessed only through inheritance.

Protected Internal:
	This compound access modifier is a combination of both Protected and Internal. 
	Class members with this access modifier can be accessed in a derived class through inheritance or by creating an object or base class. 
	But in a different assembly, this can be accessed only through inheritance and not by creating an object.

Private Protected:
	This compound access modifier is introduced to overcome the limitation of Protected Internal. 
	In a private protected access modifier, the derived class from the different assembly cannot access the members which are Private Protected.
